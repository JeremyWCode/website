            <p>My mom was born in 1961, Toronto, Canada to her mother, Elona and her father Sandor, who both immigrated from Hungary. She grew up in Toronto and when she was old enough she studied computer programming at university. She worked at Syncrude in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Then later took care of myself, my brother and sister while my Dad worked. She has 4 siblings. </p>
